## Differentiate JRE and JDK

Both are two key components of the Java ecosystem

JRE (Java Runtime Environment)

- Runs Java applications
- Includes JVM (executes bytecode), core libraries (e.g., java.lang, java.util), supporting files
- For end-users running apps (e.g., Minecraft)
- Smaller size

JDK (Java Development Kit)

- Develops Java applications
- Includes JRE + compiler (javac), debugger (jdb), tools (jar, javadoc)
- For developers writing/compiling code (e.g., in IntelliJ or Eclipse)
- Larger size

Relationship

- JRE is subset of JDK, JDK includes JRE, no separate install needed
