## Differentiate Apt and Apt-Get

Both manage packages on Debian-based distributions

apt-get

- Older, lower-level tool
- Subcommands: install, remove, update, upgrade, dist-upgrade, autoremove
- Fine-tuned control for dependencies and package states
- Backward compatible, ideal for scripts and automation.

apt

- Newer (Debian 8, Ubuntu 16.04), higher-level front-end to apt-get and apt-cache
- Streamlined commands; auto-runs update before upgrade if needed
- Not fully backward compatible, best for interactive terminal use

## Why Run Apt Update and Apt Upgrade Before Installing?

Ensures system is up-to-date for latest, compatible packages

apt update

- Updates local package index from repositories
- Fetches latest metadata to avoid missing versions or dependencies
- Prevents "package not found" errors

apt upgrade

- Upgrades installed packages to latest versions
- Fixes dependencies for new software
- Applies security patches and improves stability

Why both?

- Update fetches data, upgrade applies it. Prevents incompatibilities
- On servers, minimizes downtime

When to skip?

- If recently run with no repository changes
- In offline setups
