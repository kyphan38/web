## Knowledge Base

Definition

- A popular, free tool for automation
- Written in Java
- Very important for CI/CD

Benefits

- Helps developers automatically do repeated tasks like building, testing, and deploying a software/product
- Jenkins is known because it can change easily (flexible), grow bigger (scalable), and has many helpful plugins

Why to use?

- Made to fix problems with the old/traditional ways of making software
- Before, developers often put code together (integrated) and tested it only at the end
- Now, Jenkins lets you do this automatically right when code changes are saved in the repository
  - Helps find mistakes (errors) sooner
  - Saves time and work needed to fix them
  - Makes getting software ready faster

Main good things about Jenkins

- Automation: Does building, testing, and deploying automatically
- Find errors Early: Mistakes are found quickly when changes are added
- Notifications: Sends messages about how the build went after any changes
- CI/CD: Works as a CI server and can also be used to deploy software
- Lots of plugins: Has hundreds of helpful plugins
- Easy setup: Simple to install and set up using a website
- Grow easily (Scalable): Can be made bigger or do more using plugins
- Spread out work (Distributed): Can share tasks across many computers (using a Master-Agent setup)
