# steps

Step 1: Understand the problem

- Read the problem description at least twice to fully grasp the requirements:
  - Identify the input and output
  - Note the constraints (e.g., input size, value ranges)
  - Study the examples to understand the expected behavior

Step 2: Analyze and develop an approach

- Determine the problem’s core essence (e.g., array manipulation, dynamic programming)
- Test the problem with a small example to uncover patterns or rules
- Brainstorm a solution approach (e.g., brute force, optimized method)
- Classify the problem category (e.g., DP, graph, binary search)
- Validate your idea by mentally running it on examples, including edge cases

Step 3: Write pseudocode

- Outline your solution in pseudocode to clarify the logic and steps before coding

Step 4: Analyze time and space Complexity

- Estimate the time complexity (e.g., O(n²))
- Estimate the space complexity (e.g., O(n))
- Check if the solution meets the problem’s constraints

Step 5: Write the code

- Implement the solution in your chosen language, ensuring clarity and correctness

Step 6: Test and debug

- Run your code on the provided examples and edge cases
- Debug any issues by tracing the code and fixing errors

Step 7: Optimize the solution

- Look for ways to reduce time or space complexity
- Minimize constant factors (e.g., avoid redundant operations)
- Compare with other solutions to learn better approaches
