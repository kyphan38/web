## GNU/Linux

History

- Started in 1983 by Richard Stallman, the GNU Project aimed to build a free Unix-like OS
- By the early 1990s, GNU lacked a kernel until Linus Torvalds created the Linux kernel in 1991, released under the GNU GPL in 1992
- Together, they formed GNU/Linux, a free, open-source alternative to proprietary Unix
- GNU/Linux is packaged into user-friendly distributions like Ubuntu, Debian, and Fedora, each offering unique features and interfaces

Key features

- Free and open-source, unlike paid Unix systems
- GNU tools paired with the Linux kernel
- Kernel manages CPU, memory, and storage
- Distributions (e.g., Ubuntu for beginners, Debian for stability, Fedora for cutting-edge updates) make GNU/Linux accessible
