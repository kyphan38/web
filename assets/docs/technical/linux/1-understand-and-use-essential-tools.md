Groups

- A collection of users, primarily used to manage permissions efficiently. Users can belong to multiple groups

Essential commands

- User

```bash
# Display user account database
cat /etc/passwd
---
root:*:0:0:System Administrator:/var/root:/bin/sh
daemon:*:1:1:System Services:/var/root:/usr/bin/false

# Display user and group identity
id kyphan
---
uid=1001(kyphan) gid=1001(kyphan) groups=1001(kyphan),27(sudo)

# Display currently logged-in users
who
---
kyphan   tty1         2025-04-16 09:30
kyphan   pts/0        2025-04-16 10:15 (192.168.1.10)

# Display history of last logged-in users
last
---
kyphan   pts/0        192.168.1.10     Wed Apr 16 10:15   still logged in
kyphan   tty1                          Wed Apr 16 09:30   still logged in
reboot   system boot  5.15.0-generic   Wed Apr 16 09:25   - 10:30  (01:05)

# Search for information and home directory
grep -i kyphan /etc/passwd
---
kyphan:x:1001:1001::/home/kyphan:/bin/bash
```

- Group

```bash
# Display group database
cat /etc/group
---
root:x:0:
sudo:x:27:kyphan
kyphan:x:1001:
```

Switch users

- `su`
  - Switches to another user account. If no user is specified, it defaults to root
  - Requires the target user's password with `su -`
  - Directly using su to become root for extended periods or sharing the root password is often discouraged for security reasons

```bash
# Switch to the root user
su -
---
Password:

# Execute a single command as root
su -c "whoami"
---
Password:
root
```

- `sudo`
  - Allows permitted users to execute specific commands as another user (typically root) without needing the target user's password
  - It requires the user's own password for authentication
  - Provides better accountability and allows granting specific, limited administrative privileges instead of full root access

```bash
# Execute a command with root privileges
sudo apt-get update
---
[sudo] password for kyphan:

# Display the sudoers configuration file
cat /etc/sudoers
---
root    ALL=(ALL:ALL) ALL
%admin ALL=(ALL) ALL
%sudo   ALL=(ALL:ALL) ALL
```

- no-login shell
  - Assigns a shell like `/sbin/login`, `/usr/sbin/nologin`, or `/bin/false` to an account (often system accounts or even root on hardened systems) prevents users from logging in directly using that account
  - Enhances security by forcing administrative tasks through mechanisms like sudo or requiring a switch from a standard user account

```bash
# Check the login shell for the root user
grep '^root:' /etc/passwd
---
root:x:0:0:root:/root:/bin/bash
```

## Using System Documentation

Commands

- `--help`: Displays a brief summary of their usage and options

```bash
ls --help

# Pager
journalctl --help
```

- `man`: Displays a comprehensive manual pages

```bash
man journalctl
man man
man 1 printf
man 3 printf
```

- `apropos`: Searches the names and short descriptions of all manual pages for a specific keyword

```bash
apropos director
apropos -s 1,8 director

# Update the manual page index database
sudo mandb
```

## Additional System Documentation

- `info`: Accesses documentation in the GNU Info format

```bash
info bash
```

- `/usr/share/doc`: Contains supplementary documentation provided by installed packages

```bash
cd /usr/share/doc/bash

less INTRO

grep "command" INTRO
```

## Working With Files and Directories

List files and directories

- `ls`: Lists the contents of a directory

```bash
ls
ls -a
ls -l /var/log
ls -lah
```

Filesystem tree

- Current working directory
- Relative path
- Absolute path

```bash
cd /var/log
cd -
cd ..
```

Create files

- `touch`: Creates an empty file if it doesn't exist, or updates the access and modification timestamps of an existing file

```bash
touch /home/kyphan/text.txt
```

Create directories

- `mkdir`

```bash
mkdir -p /home/kyphan/folder
```

Copy files and directories

- `cp`: Copies files or entire directory structures

```bash
cp hello.text folder/
cp hello.txt folder/hello_copy.txt

# If hello does not exist, it copies only the contents, if not, it copies the entire folder/ to be hello/folder/
cp -r folder/ hello/

```

Move files

- `mv`: Moves files/directories to a different location or renames them

```bash
mv abc.txt hello/
mv abc.txt abcd.txt
mv folder/ new_folder/
```

Delete files and directories

- `mv`: Removes files and directories

```bash
rm abc.txt

rm -r folder
```

## Working With Hard Links

Inodes

- An inode (index node) is a data structure on Unix-like filesystems
- Each file and directory on the filesystem has a unique inode
- It stores metadata about the file or directory, excluding the filename and the actual file content
- Key metadata includes file type, permissions, owner, file size, timestamps, link count, pointers, etc.

```bash
# Create the file and write text into it
echo "Picture of Milo the dog" > Pictures/family_dog.jpg

# Display detailed status information
stat Pictures/family_dog.jpg
---
File: Pictures/family_dog.jpg
Size: 49 Blocks: 8 IO Block: 4096 regular file
Device: fd00h/64768d Inode: 52946177 Links: 1
Access: (0640/-rw-r-----) Uid: ( 1000/ aaron) Gid: ( 1005/ family)
...
```

- How it works
  - When accessing a path like Pictures/family_dog.jpg, the system locates the Pictures directory
  - It searches the directory's contents for the entry family_dog.jpg
  - This entry contains the corresponding inode number
  - The system uses the inode number to find the inode structure itself
  - From the inode, it reads metadata (like permissions) and gets the pointers to the data blocks to retrieve the file's content
- Relationship
  - A directory entry links a filename to an inode number
  - The inode stores metadata and points to the data blocks

![img](./img/1.png)

Hard links

- A hard link is simply another directory entry (another filename, potentially in a different directory) that points to the exact same inode as the original file
- Benefit
  - Allows multiple filenames to refer to the same file data without duplicating the data itself, thus saving storage space
  - Instead of having two separate copies of a large file, you have two names pointing to one set of data blocks via the shared inode

```bash
# ln path_to_target_file path_to_link_file

# Recursively copy the contents of Aaron's Pictures directory to Jane's
cp –r /home/aaron/Pictures/ /home/jane/Pictures/

# Create a hard link: Jane's path now points to the same inode as Aaron's path
ln /home/aaron/Pictures/family_dog.jpg /home/jane/Pictures/family_dog.jpg

# Display detailed status information
stat Pictures/family_dog.jpg
---
File: Pictures/family_dog.jpg
Size: 49 Blocks: 8 IO Block: 4096 regular file
Device: fd00h/64768d Inode: 52946177 Links: 2
Access: (0640/-rw-r-----) Uid: ( 1000/ aaron) Gid: ( 1005/ family)
...

# The link count for inode 52946177 decreases from 2 to 1
rm /home/aaron/Pictures/family_dog.jpg

# The link count for inode 52946177 decreases from 1 to 0
rm /home/jane/Pictures/family_dog.jpg
```

- Data deletion
  - The actual file data (disk blocks) associated with an inode is only marked for deletion (and eventually overwritten) when its link count reaches zero
  - Removing a hard link (rm) just deletes that specific directory entry and decrements the inode's link count

Limitiations and considerations

- Only hardlink to files, not folders
- Only hardlink to files on the same filesystem

```bash
# Add existing user 'aaron' to the supplementary group 'family'
useradd -a -G family aaron

# Add existing user 'jane' to the supplementary group 'family'
useradd -a -G family jane

# Change file permissions: owner=read/write, group=read/write, others=none
chmod 660 /home/aaron/Pictures/family_dog.jpg
```

## Working With Soft Links

Soft (symbolic) links

- Unlike a hard link which points directly to an inode, a symbolic link's content is simply the pathname (text string) of another file or directory (the target)
- It is used to create convenient access points, redirect paths, or link across different filesystems or partitions

![img](./img/2.png)

```bash
# ln -s path_to_target_file path_to_link_file

# Create a symbolic link named 'family_dog_shortcut.jpg' and points to the absolute path '/home/aaron/Pictures/family_dog.jpg'
ln –s /home/aaron/Pictures/family_dog.jpg family_dog_shortcut.jpg

ls -l
---
lrwxrwxrwx. 1 aaron aaron family_dog_shortcut.jpg -> /home/aaron/Pictures..

readlink family_dog_shortcut.jpg
---
/home/aaron/Pictures/family_dog.jpg

echo "Test" >> fstab_shortcut
---
bash: fstab_shortcut: Permission denied

ls -l
---
lrwxrwxrwx. 1 aaron aaron family_dog_shortcut.jpg -> /home/aaron/Pictures..

ln –s Pictures/family_dog.jpg relative_picture_shortcut
```

- If the target file or directory is deleted, moved, or renamed, the symbolic link is not automatically updated or removed
- It continues to point to the original path, which now leads nowhere. Such links are called "broken" or "dangling" links - "No such file or directory" error

Limitations and considerations

- Softlink to files and folders
- Softlink to files on different filesystem as well

## List, Set, and Change Standard Ugo/RWX Permissions

Owners and groups

```bash
chgrp kyphan family_dog.jpg
sudo chown kpfamily family_dog.jpg

ls -l
---
-rw-r-----. 1 kyphan kpfamily 49 Oct 27 14:41 family_dog.jpg

sudo chown kyphan1:kpfamily1 family_dog.jpg

ls -l
---
-rw-r-----. 1 kyphan1 kpfamily1 49 Oct 27 14:41 family_dog.jpg
```

File and directory permissions

- First character
  - Directory: d
  - Regular file: -
  - Character device: c
  - Link: l
  - Socket file: s
  - Pipe: p
  - Block device: b
- Next ones (owner, group, others)
  - r: read
  - w: write
  - x: execute
  - -: no permission
- Directory
  - r: ls, etc.
  - w: mkdir, rm, etc.
  - x: cd, etc.

Evaluating permissions

- Permissions are checked in order: Owner, group, and Others, and the system applies the permissions from the first match

```bash
ls -l
---
-r--rw----. 1 kyphan family 49 family_dog.jpg

echo “Add this content to file” >> family_dog.jpg
---
bash: family_dog.jpg: Permission denied
```

Adding permissions

- user: u+x / u+rw / u+rwx
- group: g+w / g+rw / g+rwx
- others: o+w / o+rw / o+rwx

```bash
chmod u+w family_dog.jpg
```

Removing permissions

- user: u-x / u-rw / u-rwx
- group: g-w / g-rw / g-rwx
- others: o-w / o-rw / o-rwx

```bash
chmod o-r family_dog.jpg
```

Setting exact permissions

- user: u=x / u=rw / u=rwx
- group: g=w / g=rw / g=rwx
- others: o=w / o=rw / o=rwx

```bash
chmod g=r family_dog.jpg
chmod g=rw family_dog.jpg
chmod g= family_dog.jpg
chmod g-rwx family_dog.jpg
```

Chaining permissions

```bash
chmod u+rw,g=r,o= family_dog.jpg
chmod u=rw,g-w family_dog.jpg
```

Octal permissions

```bash
stat family_dog.jpg
---
File: family_dog.jpg
Size: 49 Blocks: 8 IO Block: 4096 regular file
Device: fd00h/64768d Inode: 52946177 Links: 1
Access: (0640/-rw-r-----) Uid: ( 1000/ kyphan) Gid: ( 10/ wheel)

chmod 640 family_dog.jpg
```

## SUID, SGID, and Sticky Bit

SUID

- Set User Identification
- When an executable file has the SUID bit set, any user who runs that file temporarily gains the privileges of the file's owner during its execution
- This allows regular users to perform specific actions that would normally require higher privileges

```bash
chmod u+s family_dog.jpg
chmod 4755 family_dog.jpg
```

SGID

- When set on an executable file, the process runs with the privileges of the file's group. This is similar to SUID but operates at the group level
- This is the more common and significant use of SGID. When a directory has the SGID bit set, any new files or subdirectories created within it will automatically inherit the group ownership of the parent directory, rather than the primary group of the user who created the file
- This is particularly useful for shared project directories where multiple users need to collaborate on a set of files. All new files will belong to the designated project group, ensuring consistent access for all team members

```bash
chmod g+s family_folder
chmod 2755 family_folder
```

Sticky bit

- When the sticky bit is set on a directory, it restricts file deletion
- Even if a user has write permissions to the directory, they can only delete or rename files that they personally own
- The directory owner and the root user are exceptions and can delete or rename any file within the directory

```bash
chmod 777 family_folder
chmod +t family_folder

chmod 1777 family_folder
```

Note

- Lowercase s or t: The special permission is set, and the underlying execute (x) permission is also set for that user/group/other. This is the correct and effective state
- Uppercase S or T: The special permission is set, but the underlying execute (x) permission is not set. In this state, the special permission has no effect
