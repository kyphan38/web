# vault tls login

```bash
mkdir -p ~/vault-certs/read/.key
```

Generate a self-signed CA certificate

Create a CA private key and certificate

```bash
openssl genrsa -out ~/vault-certs/read/ca.key 2048
openssl req -x509 -new -nodes -key ~/vault-certs/read/ca.key -sha256 -days 365 -out ~/vault-certs/read/ca.pem -subj "/CN=LocalVaultCA"
```

Generate a client certificate and key

Create a client private key and certificate signing request (CSR)

```bash
openssl genrsa -out ~/vault-certs/read/.key/client.key 2048
openssl req -new -key ~/vault-certs/read/.key/client.key -out ~/vault-certs/read/client.csr -subj "/CN=vault-client"
```

Sign the client certificate with the CA

```bash
openssl x509 -req -in ~/vault-certs/read/client.csr -CA ~/vault-certs/read/ca.pem -CAkey ~/vault-certs/read/ca.key -CAcreateserial -out ~/vault-certs/read/client.crt -days 365 -sha256
```
